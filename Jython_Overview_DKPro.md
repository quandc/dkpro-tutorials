## Introduction ##


## Components ##
DKPro gives an easy interface to different components for many basic NLP tasks such as segmentation, part-of-speech-tagging or named entity recognition.

An overview of the currently available components can be found in the [DKPro Wiki](https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/wiki/WikiEntryPage?tm=6).

If you like to know how to choose the right components, please see the following Wiki entry: [Choosing Components](https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/wiki/ChoosingComponents).


## Models ##
Some of the analysis components can be run with different models, e.g. we can run a POS-tagger with models that were trained on different corpora. For an overview of the existent models in DKPro, see [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ApGcdapz0xSYdFNTREhKeFVEU1RsQzc0V0NKcE04b3c&single=true&gid=0&output=html).
