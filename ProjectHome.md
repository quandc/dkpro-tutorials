# DKPro Tutorials #

DKPro tutorials provide hands-on, step-by-step instructions on how to use DKPro products.

This project has been launched in June 2013 and we are continuously adding more learning content and tutorials.

## Is this tutorial site right for you? ##

We will offer tutorials on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) software collection DKPro, which covers a wide range of NLP essentials, including tools and resources such as:
  * [DKPro Core](http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/) a UIMA-based framework for linguistic annotation of text
  * [DKPro Lab](http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-lab/), a UIMA-based workflow engine for parameter sweeping experiments
  * [DKPro Similarity](http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-similarity-asl/), a comprehensive repository of text similarity measures to be used in combination with DKPro Core
  * [UBY](http://code.google.com/p/uby/), a large-scale linked lexical resource based on the  [ISO standard LMF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_Markup_Framework)


The tutorials assume Java programming skills and general familiarity with NLP methods and tools. Ideally, you have prior knowledge of lexical-semantic resources such as [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) and [FrameNet](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/) as well. Familiarity with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) is a plus, but not required.
